# MATLAB Programming

### MATLAB programming for Brain, Biological, and Cognitive Scientists

This repository contains programming exercises using MATLAB which is a special-purpose language that makes it possible to write a powerful moderate-size program to solve computational problems. With a focus within the fields of biology, neuroscience, and cognitive sciences, the coding examples consists of programming assignments and a data project that illustrates the importance of computational concepts, data analysis and modeling through implementation.


Through this programming exercises, I gained:

    (i) experience with general concepts in computer science
    (ii) an understanding of the general concepts of programming and
    (iii) obtained a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB.
